<p>IEEE Women in Engineering (WIE) is one of the largest international professional organizations 
dedicated to promoting women engineers and scientists, and inspiring girls around the world to follow
their academic interests in a career in engineering.</p>
<h2>MISSION &amp; VISION</h2>
<p> Our goal is to facilitate the recruitment and retention of women in technical disciplines globally
.&nbsp;We&nbsp;envision a vibrant community of IEEE women and men collectively using their diverse talents 
to innovate for the benefit of humanity.</p>
<p><h2>IEEE WIE Strives to&hellip;</h2></p>
<ul>
<li>Recognize the outstanding achievements of women in electrical and electronics engineering through IEEE Awards nominations</li>
<li>Organize receptions at major technical conferences to enhance networking and to promote membership in WIE</li>
<li>Advocate women in leadership roles in IEEE governance, and career advancement for women in the profession</li>
<li>Provide assistance with the formation of new WIE Affinity Groups, and support ongoing activities</li>
<li>Promote IEEE member grade advancement for women to the membership grades of Senior member and Fellow</li>
<li>Facilitate the development of programs and activities that promote the entry into, and retention of, women in engineering programs</li>
<li>Administer the IEEE Student-Teacher and Research Engineer/Scientist (STAR) Program to mentor young women in junior and high school</li>
</ul>
<p>WeIcome to the IEEE GCET- Student Branch where members instigate a worldwide community through IEEE's extremely cited publications and conferences.</p>
<p>The IEEE &ndash; GCET student branch &nbsp;was inaugurated in 2010 with a membership no of 100 students, 10 faculty advisors and a branch Counsellor
 and The branch has been assigned a Branch code STB- 05841 and COLLEGE code -60050138 WIE AG Geo-code:SB05841 The student Branch emphasis on conducting 
more activites and technical events which can develop the skills of a student in both technical and managerial.</p>
<p>We believe that in the ever evolving world of today, networking is the key for knowledge advancement. So, with the international fraternity provided 
to us by the IEEE this is the perfect way to milk information from the experts themselves and be a part of something that is bigger than ourselves.</p>
